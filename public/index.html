      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2>1- What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?</h2>
    <p>Ans-- <br>
      ReactJS and React Native are both Facebook natives that offer unmatched power to mobile app and web development. The differences between the two come down to their functionality and critical purposes. 
      Today, the differences between React Native and ReactJS are noticeable on websites that are popular all over the world. These two powerful technologies are the foundation of many popular websites and mobile applications.
      The conversation examining ReactJS vs. React Native is a common one in the app development field. However, even seasoned developers can be unclear on the nuances in the React vs React Native argument.
    </p>
    <h3>library or framework</h3>
    <p>Developers often use the terms “library” and “framework” as if they were the same. But there is a         difference.

      Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.
      
      We can use a house as a metaphor to explain the difference between these concepts.
      
      A library is like building your home from scratch, you have the choice to make your house as you wish, with any architecture you like, you can sort your rooms in the way you like..</p>

    <h2>2- What is the package name you are using for routing</h2>
    <p>
        React Router is a standard library system built on top of the React and used to create routing in the React application using React Router Package.In this Browser Router as Router, Routes and Route and NavLink get imported from react-router-dom. React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Ans--see the top -----</h2>

    <h2>4- How do you pass data from parent to child ??</h2>

    <h2>5- What is lazy loading in react ?</h2>
    <p> 
      Lazy loading is a design pattern for optimizing web and mobile apps. The concept of lazy loading is simple: initialize objects that are critical to the user interface first and quietly render noncritical items later. <br>

       When you visit a website or use an app, it’s very likely you’re not seeing all the available content. Depending on how you navigate and use the app, you may never encounter the need for certain components, and loading unneeded items costs time and computing resources. Lazy loading enables you to render elements on demand, making your app more efficient and improving the user experience.

    <h2>6- Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component</h2>
    <h4>Stateless-</h4>
    <p>If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless we need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, we should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.</p>
    <pre>
      const BooksList = ({books}) => {
        return (
          <ul>
            {books.map(book => {
              return <li>book</li>
            })}
          </ul>
        )
       }
    </pre>
    <h4>Stateful--</h4>
    <p>If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.</p>
    <pre>
      class Main extends Component {
        constructor() {
          super()
          this.state = {
            books: []
          }
        }
        render() {
          return <BooksList books={this.state.books} />;
        }
       }
      </pre>

      <li>history.push</li>
      <li>history.replace</li>
      <li>Link is used to manage the navigation and it worked as an anchor tag. Check below code for the demonstration. import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'; ... ...
